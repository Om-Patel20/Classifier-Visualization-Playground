# Classifier-Visualization-Playground
The purpose of this notebook is to let you visualize various classsifiers' decision boundaries.
The data used in this notebook is based on the UCI Mushroom Data Set stored in mushrooms.csv.
In order to better vizualize the decision boundaries, we'll perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the data to reduce the dimensionality to 2 dimensions.
